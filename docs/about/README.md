## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at Computer Science Department of The University of Hong Kong (HKU). My research interests include **cryptography**, **privacy**, and **blockchain**. I'm mainly working on **cryptographic protocols**, such as **multi-party computation (MPC)**, **zero-knowledge proofs**, etc.

  Harry's wand was broken in 1997, but was repaired by him after the 1998 Battle of Hogwarts. Usually the repair of a wand is impossible, but with the use of the Elder Wand it was achievable.
